Description: Reader Writer solution. Random number of readers and writers created, who sleep for a time.


How to use the program:
1. "make" to compile the program.
2. Expected Use: ./ass2


Additional Information:

-A random number of threads are created, some of which will be readers, and some writers. You may have to execute multiple times to see how the mutex works fully.

-A thread ID is used to identify each thread, I'm not sure as to the usefulness the numbers beyond that, they are the pthread object returned by pthread_self(), cast as an int.
